I have completed the character comparison page assignment using React.

You can access the site with the following link: https://fbpuq1.csb.app/
You can inspect the source code by clicking "Open Sandbox" located at the bottom right corner of the screen.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you very much,

# Comparing World Of Rick And Morty

This project is a side-by-side comparison page for two characters from the popular TV show, Rick and Morty. The page allows users to search for characters, add/remove them to the comparison, and view details such as their picture, name, and an additional character attribute.

The data for the characters is pulled from the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

The project was built using JavaScript, a front-end framework (React), and the Rick and Morty API documentation.

You can view the live project at https://fbpuq1.csb.app/

# Delopment Proccess

I selected React as my preferred framework for developing the website due to my familiarity with it and its reputation for being fast and efficient. To optimize the website's performance, I frequently employed the technique of "Hoisting the State" and implemented a modular design by creating a reusable component for character comparison. Despite encountering an issue with naming conventions early on, I was able to quickly resolve it and ensure consistency throughout the development process.


## API Reference

https://rickandmortyapi.com/

The Rick and Morty API is a REST(ish) and GraphQL API based on the television show Rick and Morty. You will have access to about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes. The Rick and Morty API is filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show.

I used this two end points.

#### Get all character

```http
  GET /api/character
```

#### Get character

```http
  GET /api/character/?name=${name}
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `name`      | `string` | **Required**. name of character to fetch |
